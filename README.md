# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Alison Glasenapp**, a backend developer from Brazil with a strong focus on **PHP** and **PostgreSQL**. I'm passionate about building real-world solutions, improving legacy systems, and I'm also a huge **AI enthusiast**, always exploring how to integrate machine learning into practical applications.

### ðŸ“Œ Pinned Projects

Here are a couple of projects I'm proud of.

<br>

#### ðŸ“„ [Chat with PDF](https://github.com/Glasena/chat-with-pdf).

A full-stack application that implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, allowing users to have contextual, in-depth conversations with their PDF documents. The project showcases a sophisticated, dual-model architecture using specialized LLMs for embedding and generation, served locally via Ollama.

*This project was a deep dive into creating data-grounded AI systems, moving beyond simple prompting to build a tool with memory, configurable logic, and true contextual understanding.*

`Tech Stack: React, FastAPI, Python, Docker, LangChain, Ollama, Llama 3, FAISS`

#### ðŸ¤– [Philosophers Chatbot](https://github.com/Glasena/philosophers-chatbot)
A full-stack AI application that allows users to chat with different philosophical personas (a Stoic and a Cynic). The entire environment is containerized with Docker, featuring a React frontend, a FastAPI (Python) backend, and a locally-run Llama 3 model with GPU acceleration via Ollama.

*This project serves as a hands-on lab for learning and exploring LLM fine-tuning techniques.*

#### ðŸ’¸ [Finances Controll](https://github.com/Glasena/controle-financeiro) Â 
A personal project built with Laravel 12 and PostgreSQL to automate the extraction and analysis of financial data from bank statements and credit cards (Nubank, BB, XP), preparing the data for BI tools.

`Tech Stack: Laravel, PHP, PostgreSQL, PDF Parsing`
